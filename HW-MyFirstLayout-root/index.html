        <h2>Why UX-UI?</h2>
            
                <p>I love color and enjoy designing.</p>
                <p>Providing a good user experience is fulfilling.</p>
                <p>Wouldn't it be nice to finally put that art degree to work?</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Visio can be used to create cross-stitch designs, better than many programs 
                    that are made for cross-stitch designing, <br>because it's easy to create and 
                    save templates. The main drawback is there is no way to match Visio colors
                    with thread <br>colors. It's really impossible to show variegated colors.
                </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Years ago, I served dinner to former president Gerald Ford at the Claremont
                    Hotel in Oakland. I was informed, that as<br> his waiter, it was my responsibility 
                    to taste his food before serving him. Not willing to risk my life, I asked Mr.
                    Ford. <br>He laughed and said it wasn't necessary. Darn, that steak looked good!
