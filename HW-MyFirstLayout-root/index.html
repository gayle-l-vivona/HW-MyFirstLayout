        <h1>Why UX-UI?</h1>
            <p>Web design is fascinating.</p>
            <p>Wouldn't it be nice to finally put that art degree to work?</p>

        <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>I used Visio to create cross-stitch designs, because it was on my work laptop 
                    <br>and I knew how to use it. Visio makes it easy to save patterns and templates, 
                    <br>but it's difficult to get accurate colors.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Years ago, I served dinner to former president Gerald Ford at the Claremont
                    <br>Hotel in Oakland. I was informed, that as his waiter, it was my responsibility 
                    <br>to taste his food before serving him. Not willing to risk my life, I asked Mr. 
                    <br>Ford. He laughed and said it wasn't necessary. Darn, that steak looked good!
